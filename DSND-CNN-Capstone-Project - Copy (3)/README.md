### 1. Project Motivation and Overview
This project is the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone Project. It presents the claasification of human and dog images using Convolutional Neural Network. 


### 2. Requirement
- Python 3
- sklearn
- Numpy
- TensorFlow  
- keras
- glob
- cv2
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- PIL


### 3. File Descriptions
- There are 4 folders, 1 notebooks and 1 python script in this repo. The **bottleneck_features** folder should contain the VGG16 bottleneck features which is implemented in the Step 4 of the dog_app.ipynb file.

- The **haarcascades** folder should contain the OpenCV haarcascades face detector model which is implemented in the Step 1 of the dog_app.ipynb file.

- The **images** folder should contain the dataset images. It should be divided into subfolders titled **train**, **valid** and **test** respectively

- The **saved_models** folder should contain the files for the pretrained ResNet50, VGG16 and Xception models used in the Step 2, 4 and 5 sessions of the dog_app.ipynb file respectively.

- The **extract_bottleneck_features.py** script contains the caller functions for downloading the pretrained models and predicting models with them.

- The **dog_app.ipynb** notebook is the main file which displays the classifcation models and illustartions.




### 4. Implementation
- To implementation of all the imported models and built models are in the **dog_app.ipynb** notebook which is implemented using the Keras open-source neural network library with a TensorFlow backend. 

```bat
open cmd
>>> jupyter notebook
cd to your file directory
open dog_app.ipynb
```
